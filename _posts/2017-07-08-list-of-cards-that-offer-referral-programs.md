**Note that referred credit card offers are not necessarily the best you can get (mostly for AMEX cards). AMEX does offer the same for both referred and public application when there is a promotion. Otherwise, you can still find targeted offer links or use the "incognito" browser trick or the VPN trick to find those.**
